# The general Idea explanation

**App Name:** Silverlink ( Silver Eng. - argint. The elderly generation is considered the "Silver generation", so the app's name comes from the general idea of the app - to link seniors to combat loneliness and all the challenges that come with it)

**Tagline:** Your digital companion for connection, joy, and staying sharp.

**Description:**
Loneliness doesn't have to be part of aging. Silverlink is your friendly, easy-to-use app designed specifically for seniors. Connect with loved ones, rediscover old passions, explore new interests, and feel a little less alone.
## Functionalities
**Base Functions of the app:**
- Local news from multiple Moldovan newsletters
- Mood sharing - so everyone would know how our dear elderly people feel, and offer them corresponding support
- Photo uploading - so the seniors can share memories, how they feel and what they are doing
- Conversations - to connect with their close people
- Social assistant - so they would find answers to the questions they have

Being lonely doesn't only influence people's mentality and emotional state, but many other aspects of their lives as well. Besides mental and emotional challenges, lonely elders can also face physical and practical challenges. These challenges can impact their well-being, independence, and quality of life.

We know that each problem has a solution, and in our project we have approached the most important and common challenges, but all of them can and will be implemented in the future, so our seniors will have a simple app with many functionalities, because our focus is the ease of use, while having a lot of options to choose from.
## Difficulties
Talking in more detail about the challenges the elderly people encounter and the solutions to be implemented in our app, we have the following:
- Physical
	- Chronic health conditions (*Many seniors manage conditions that can limit mobility, increase pain, and necessitate frequent medical care. Some of which can be treated or reduce pain naturally*) - Diseases descriptions with the symptoms and natural solutions to solve them
	- Decreased mobility (*- Physical changes lead to decreased strength, balance, and flexibility. This can make everyday tasks difficult, increase the risk of falls, and contribute to social isolation.*) - Online fitness classes (group activity)
	- Cognitive difficulties (*It is not easy for the elderly people to learn by themselves about technologies and all the functionalities our app will provide.) - Technical tutorials
- Practical:
	- Financial worries (*Many seniors live on fixed incomes, leading to financial stress, particularly with rising healthcare costs.*) - Budgeting tools
	- Transportation difficulties (*Decreased driving ability can make getting to appointments, stores, and social activities a challenge, especially in areas with poor public transit.*) - Accessible Public Transit Maps
	- Navigation difficulties (*Fast-paced technology changes can be difficult to keep up with, creating barriers for online services and connection.*) - "Landmark" Navigation
- Emotional:
	- Loneliness and isolation (*Loss of loved ones, decreased mobility, and retirement can lead to fewer social connections, increasing feelings of loneliness.*) - Intergenerational Exchanges and Events list with online/offline participation
	- Depression and anxiety (*Seniors can be more susceptible to mental health concerns due to life changes, medical conditions, and underlying anxieties.*) - Mindfulness & Mood Support (Guided meditations, breathing exercises, or relaxing music,) Personalized Recommendations (when entering the app, recommend uplifting activities like social interaction, communication, sport)
	- Lack of purpose (*Retirement and changed roles can lead to a feeling of lost purpose, which impacts self-esteem and motivation.*) - Skills Marketplace (a place where elderly people can find interesting skills easy to learn, with step by step tutorials)

5. **App Costs Explained**
	- **App Store Deployment:** There's a yearly fee of $100 to acquire the developer kit, used to publish the app on the Apple app store.
